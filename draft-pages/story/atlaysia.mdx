### Technologists enabling collaboration

Young but mighty is the civilization of Atlaysia, prosperous in their impact on most other nations of report.

Their Business Collaboration Chips have been adopted by most great people groups, enabling increased worker productivity and unleashing of potential in organic and synthetic systems of labour.

Ruled by the _Twin Kings_, since it's inception Atlaysia has excelled in many dimensions under their guidance and leadership. Not without conflict of course but every storm has been weathered and the future is bright.

One of the key challenges is their topography of an Archipelago – that is collection of island states that are not always as connected as you'd hope the would be.

The Capital, _Arij Major_, is the most connected to the other states but many bridges still need to be built. Indeed the _Arij Major and Minor_ states are all relatively cohesive in their trade and efficiency protocols. The other islands are at times neglected however, especially when it comes to infrastructure investment.

Part of this comes down to the nature of their how they came to be included in the domain of Atlaysia. Initially a single island of _Arij_, Atlaysia slowly grew in population and size. Mostly organically but once reaching sufficient magnitude it was able to exert enough influence so as to absorb neighbouring islands or construct whole news ones synthetically.

_Fluence_ was the first foray into such an endeavour, constructed from nothing and built into a wondrous new island that could stand on it's own merit free from the influence of _Arij_.

There are still new _Arij Minors_ being built to this day with optimizations ever being identified and implemented as the leaders see fit. Expanding their appeal beyond that of traditional technologists but attracting the attention of those of the edges of innovation as well.

_Salta_ is one of the newest islands in the greater Archipelago, a small state with grand aspirations – seeking to wield influence across all of Atlaysia and beyond. The development of these smaller states is ever in flux with the review of the monarchs and other leaders constantly at play.

Other islands were originally independent nations that sought refuge under the wings of Atlaysia or were enticed by the shine of coin. Deep coffers mean a deep well of strength when it comes to negotiations with those outside the island borders. Ever open to collaboration, often dependent on a term sheet.

_The Epoch_ has breached the walls of most, if not all, states of Atlaysia at this point. Time will tell how it affects those within it's jurisdiction and sphere of influence.
