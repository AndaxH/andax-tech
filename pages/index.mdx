👋 Hey, I enjoy gaming and all things tech. From studying Ancient History for my undergrad degree,
I was lucky enough to land into the world of working in technology.

A mate from church referred me for a contractor position in the recruiting team at Atlassian.
After a few years – focused mostly on grad and intern recruiting – I made the switch to working in
the R&D side of the business building software.

    Enough people asked me how I moved from a non-technical role to being a
    Software Developer that I put together a collection of the online tech
    training resources I used as part of my career transition -{' '}
