👋 Hey, I enjoy gaming and all things tech. From studying Ancient History for my undergrad degree,
I was lucky enough to land into the world of working in technology.

A mate from church referred me for a contractor position in the recruiting team at Atlassian.
After a few years – focused mostly on grad and intern recruiting – I made the switch to working in
the R&D side of the business building software.

I'm currently a Software Engineering Manager at Atlassian 🇦🇺

👨‍💻 Currently working on a new "Teamwork Directory" product called [Atlas](http://atlassian.com/software/atlas) -
it's pretty neat.
