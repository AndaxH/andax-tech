### 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the internet

Hey, my name is Andy Hammond and I'm known online by some variation of Andax. I'm an <img alt="AU" loading="lazy" width="16" height="12" decoding="async" src="https://flag.vercel.app/s/AU.svg" style={{display: 'inline', margin: '0 0 0 4px', color: 'transparent', borderRadius: '2px', userSelect: 'none'}}/> Australian who enjoys gaming and all things tech.

I'm married to a wonderful woman named Alexandra, we have a beautiful little girl 👶 Ellie and a fluff butt named 😸 Ambrosia.

I'm also a ✝️ believing Anglican, a few favourite verses are [Isaiah 40:30-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040%3A30-31&version=NIV) and [Matthew 9:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209%3A12-13&version=NIV).

From studying Ancient History for my undergrad degree after high school, I luckily stumbled into the world of working in tech.

### 👨‍💻 Work

A mate from church referred me for a contractor position in the recruiting team at Atlassian. After a few years – focused mostly on grad and intern recruiting – I made the switch to working in the R&D side of the business building software.

Most recently I've been working as a Senior Software Developer at Atlassian on the new [Customer Service Management (CSM)](https://www.atlassian.com/software/customer-service-management) product in the Central AI department.

Previously I worked on our "Teamwork Directory" product called 🌐 [Atlas](http://atlassian.com/software/atlas) - which has now been made part of the Atlassian platform. Check it out 👀

https://www.atlassian.com/loop/about is another great resource if wanting to adopt the features of Atlas at your company.

A highlight of my time working on Atlas was the opportunity to go through the Apprentice Manager Program and work as an Engineering Manager in a leadership triad with a Product Manager and Designer for a team of 6 Software Developers.

Before Atlas I worked on the Growth Optimization team at Atlassian, where I helped develop A/B tests and experiments to improve the user experience and discoverability of Atlassian's products.

Throughout my career I've most enjoyed working within small teams, especially focused on new and experimental projects that are in the 0 → 1 product engineering space.

### 📚 Learning

If you're interested in starting a career in the technology industry check out the [Resource Library](/resource-library) I've put together.

A major factor in making my career change successful was the wealth of high quality resources available online.

Second only to the [friends and family](/gratitude) who supported me along the way.
