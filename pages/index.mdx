### 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the internet

I'm an 🇦🇺 Australian who enjoys gaming and all things tech.

I'm married to a wonderful woman named Alexandra and we have a 😸 fluff butt named Ambrosia. Also a ✝️ believing Anglican, a few favourite verses are [Isaiah 40:30-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040%3A30-31&version=NIV) and [Matthew 9:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209%3A12-13&version=NIV).

From studying Ancient History for my undergrad degree after high school, I luckily stumbled into the world of working in tech.

### 👨‍💻 Work

A mate from church referred me for a contractor position in the recruiting team at Atlassian. After a few years – focused mostly on grad and intern recruiting – I made the switch to working in the R&D side of the business building software.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineering Manager at Atlassian on our new "Teamwork Directory" product called 🌐 [Atlas](http://atlassian.com/software/atlas) - I think it's pretty neat. Check it out 👀

https://www.atlassian.com/loop/about is another great resource if wanting to adopt Atlas at your company.

### 📚 Learning

If you're interested in starting a career in the technology industry check out the [Resource Library](/resource-library) I've put together.

A major factor in making my career change successful was the wealth of high quality resources available online.

Second only to the [friends and family](/gratitude) who supported me along the way.
