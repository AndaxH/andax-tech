### 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the internet

I enjoy gaming and all things tech. From studying Ancient History for my undergrad degree, I was lucky enough to land into the world of working in technology.

### 👨‍💻 Work

A mate from church referred me for a contractor position in the recruiting team at Atlassian. After a few years – focused mostly on grad and intern recruiting – I made the switch to working in the R&D side of the business building software.

I'm currently a Software Engineering Manager at Atlassian 🇦🇺

Currently working on a new "Teamwork Directory" product called 🌐 [Atlas](http://atlassian.com/software/atlas) - I think it's pretty neat. Check it out 👀

### 📚 Learning

If you're interested in starting a career in the technology industry check out the [Resource Library](/resource-library) I've put together. A major factor that contributed to my successful career change into tech was the wealth of high quality resources available online.
