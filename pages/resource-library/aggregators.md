# Aggregators

There's a number of excellent resources online that act as aggregators which have put together
collections of useful topics to then explore more deeply.

Check out [Aggregation Theory](https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/) to learn more about this
trend for the internet on [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/) which is
a tech, business newsletter written by [@benthompson](https://twitter.com/benthompson)

## [Developer Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/)

> roadmap.sh is a community effort to create roadmaps, guides and other educational content to help guide the developers in picking up the path and guide their learnings.

What's also cool is that the entire site is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) on GitHub: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
