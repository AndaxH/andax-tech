# Resource Library

When I first made the switch to working as a Software Developer I had a lot of friends and acquaintances reach out asking how I did it. That led me to put together this article https://medium.com/@andaxhambert/so-you-want-to-become-a-software-developer-collection-of-tech-training-resources-6ba52b299cd9

Since then I've only had more people over the years reach out, hence the creation of this Resource Library for all to benefit from.

## Transparency

I've written up a page for the site called [Transparency](/transparency) inspired by https://kentcdodds.com/transparency to provide some context around where my money comes from and where your money would go if you choose to support me.

Check out the pages and links below that make up the resource library itself ðŸ‘€
