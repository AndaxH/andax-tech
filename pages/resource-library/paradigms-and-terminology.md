# Paradigms and Terminology

## [Object Orientated Programming [OOP]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code.

## [Functional Programming [FP]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

### [Lambda](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3865335/what-is-a-lambda-language)

> A lambda language, in simple terms, is a language that allows passing a function to another function, where the function is treated as any other variable

### [Currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying)

> In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument.
