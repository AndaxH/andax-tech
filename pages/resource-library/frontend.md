###### An image illustrating a mental model for thinking about Frontend technologies.

###### HTML as a human's skeleton, JavaScript as the brain & nervous system and CSS as their skin & hair & clothing (including a shirt that says Mr. Website)

- HTML (Skeleton)
  - Your foundational structure for webpages
- JavaScript (Nervous System)
  - The behaviour / functionality of webpages
- CSS (Skin, Hair and Clothes)
  - How elements appear and are rendered visually
