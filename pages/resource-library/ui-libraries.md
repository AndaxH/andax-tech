# UI Libraries

Below is a collection of some UI libraries to check out. One of the best things you can do as a software developer is become familiar with tools available to you. A lot of the time you don't need to build a component from scratch, there will be a viable one to use with a flexible usage license.

Many of these advertise themselves as a "Design System" – essentially a cohesive set of components designed to be modular and consistent to facilitate building delightful web experiences. They often have high standards for accessibility as well.

You can think of them as providing a set of primitives that you can then use as the building blocks for building webpages with. If unfamiliar with these concepts, check out https://www.figma.com/design-systems to find out more.
