# Daily Bible Verse

Reading the bible doesn't always come naturally and can be a daunting task. I've found it encouraging collecting a selection of 
favourite verses to read over and use for personal encouragement.

To help with ease of access I created the [Daily Bible Verse](/verses/index.html) page the shows a random favourite verse on each
reload along with a random verse from the book of Proverbs which is full of dense and insightful standalone verses (doesn't always pick 
a great one to read on it's own though 😅).
