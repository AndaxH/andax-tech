# WoW Board Game App

Me and a bunch of mates from work are big fans of classic Blizzard games. This includes World of Warcraft
which believe it or not has a board game version that was released in 2005. We enjoy playing this on
weekends away but it's a complex game with many aspects to keep track off. To help with this we collaboratively
built a [WoW board game companion app](https://github.com/rissole/wow-board-game-app) that is a WIP.
Awaiting more data entry of cards and assets from the game ðŸ˜….

We even had the privilege of going to BlizzCon in 2015, which thanks to some work connections, included
a tour of the Irvine Blizzard HQ offices.
