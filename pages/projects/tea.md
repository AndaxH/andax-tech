# Tea Randomizer

We love a cuppa in our household ☕️🫖 and have a sizeable collection of different types and varieties of tea. It 
became a bit burdensome to list of all the choices so I built a simple web page to help list everything we have available. 

It's a very basic page but [Tea Randomizer](/tea/index.html) serves the job and even enables you to pick one at random with 
some guardrails (e.g. herbal and teabag). We even keep it semi-updated regularly although there are some main stays that are 
always well stocked.
