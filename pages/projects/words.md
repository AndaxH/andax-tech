description: Daily Target 9-Letter Word Builder Game
tag: personal project
---

Hosted on its own subdomain of [words.andax.tech](https://words.andax.tech/) I built this with the assistance
of Claude Code. My wife enjoys playing puzzle games and regularly has a puzzle book on the go. One of the puzzle types
often included in these are target 9-letter word builders. I have fond memories of doing these among others in the back of newspapers
once my parents were done with them.

I set out to build an online version of these which would daily have a new puzzle to do inspired by similar games like
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Squaredle](https://squaredle.app/).
