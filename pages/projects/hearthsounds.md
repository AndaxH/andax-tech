# Hearthsounds

I built [Hearthsounds](https://hearthsounds.github.io) with my mate Blake from work as a fun side project, this was when I was getting
more serious into learning web development and building software in general.

We gave ourselves a constraint of only using vanilla JS, along with HTML and CSS, to learn more of
the standard web APIs available. It was a lot of fun and I'm still proud of what we managed to put
together from a few afternoons hacking away at it after work.

It involved some python scripting to scrape some assets from Hearthstone fan sites/wiki pages and
then creating the sound guessing game which had 5 minutes of fame in the games community.
