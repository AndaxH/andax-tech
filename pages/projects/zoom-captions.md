# Zoom Captions

When the Covid19 pandemic hit Australia around March 2020 it meant suddenly many aspects of life moved
to online alternatives. This included church services on a Sunday and meant live streaming and
congregating on Zoom calls instead of church halls.

This included the music for each service with musos playing from their lounge rooms for all to sing
along with. Sharing a traditional PowerPoint slide with the lyrics like we would in church meant
you couldn't easily see the musicians or your fellow worshippers.

To help assist with this I built a very basic [Zoom Captions tool](/zoom-captions/index.html) that
made it easier for the tech team to send captions with the lyrics as the song was played through Zoom for everyone.
It was a fun little project to put together and got shared with many other churches for use as they
adjusted to online services.
