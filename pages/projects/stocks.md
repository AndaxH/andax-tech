# Stocks Earning Calendar

Hosted on its own subdomain of [stocks.andax.tech](https://stocks.andax.tech/) I vibe coded this simple web app 
using the [v0](https://v0.app/) offering from Vercel. It lets you search for stocks by name or ticker symbol and then 
calls some financial APIs to fetch info about the next earnings call for said company.

It then lets you add the date of the earnings call as an event on your Google Calendar which serves as a useful 
reminder if you want to keep track of such things.
