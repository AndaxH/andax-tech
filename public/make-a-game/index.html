          You may have seen ^ this guy on the internet lately. His name is Thor,
          and he makes games.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wants others to make video games too, and that's why he made the
          website <a href="https://develop.games">develop.games</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the video above he talks through that whole site (it's a great
          watch) but I've embedded it at the point he talks about the
          <a href="https://develop.games/#nav-type"
            >What kind of game should I make?</a
          >
          section of his website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made this micro-site to help folks getting started, by giving them a
          "make a game" button.
        </p>
        <p>
          Will it sort out the software development, art and music for your
          game? No. Will it spit out a fun randomized genre + theme for your
          game? Yes! <sub>(don't worry it won't suggest making a mmo)</sub>
        </p>
        <h3>You should make a...</h3>
        <p id="result-text">ðŸ‘€</p>
        <button id="randomize">Randomize!</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="make-a-game.js"></script>
  </body>
